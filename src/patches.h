!Description: Header file for patches.c - see patches.c for more information.

!Revision History:
 Revision 1.0 2001/05/08
 Robert Wolfe
 Original Version.

 Revision 1.5 2002/12/02
 Gail Schmidt
 Added support for INT8 data types.

 Revision 2.2.0 2010/07/29
 Kirk Evenson

 Reworked nearest neighbor resampling so that it will use the bilinear
 mechanism to identify which input pixel is closest to an output pixel.
 Plus corrected nearest neighbor so it selects the nearest input pixel 
 rather than sum and average a number of input pixels.

 
!Team Unique Header:
  This software was developed by the MODIS Land Science Team Support 
  Group for the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics (Code 922) at the 
  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Goddard Space Flight 
  Center, under NASA Task 92-012-00.

 ! Design Notes:
   1. Structures are declared for the Patches_mem, Patches_loc and Patches 
      data types.
   2. The data type Patch_status is defined.
   3. The number of samples and lines in a patch are 'NLINE_PATCH' and 
      'NSAMPLE_PATCH', respectively.
